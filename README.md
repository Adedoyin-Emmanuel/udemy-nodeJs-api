Testing my nodeJs skills by building a backend server that gets all udemy courses. This is a test repo, with leaked API keys, since udemy has a free API endpoint there is no harm 🤗
## Wish me goodluck boys, I need it 👍
Funny I built this in less than 10 minutes, I've improved my nodejs knowledge for real 😄
